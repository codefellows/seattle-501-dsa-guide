## GitHub repository

Create a new repository on GitHub. You will continue to expand on this repository in your 401 course. The repository should have a root `README.md` file with an overview of the purpose of the repository. 

Create a folder for every code challenge assigned in class, and create a new branch for every new problem-set.

When you finish each problem set, make a new pull request from your daily challenge branch to your master branch and submit the PR URL in Canvas. You can submit a link to a pull request even if the pull request is closed.
